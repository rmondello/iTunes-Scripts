### About

Ricky's AppleScripts for iTunes.

### Install

	# Ensure ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/ exists.
	mv *.scpt ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/

### Extra

These scripts shine when used with a global keyboard trigger. [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) or about a dozen other apps do this nicely.

### The Scripts

#### CloudTunes.scpt

Uploads the currently-playing track to [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com).

#### Silent Growl-Enabled Whack Current Track.scpt

With confirmation, removes the currently-playing track from one's iTunes library and the filesystem, displaying a Growl notification with the results of its run.

##### Credit

[Doug Adams's "Whack Current Track"](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/) AppleScript does all of the real work of these scripts. These are trivial modifications.
